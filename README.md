## 🧠 About me
🇻🇪 Born in Venezuela, raised in Florida, went to school in Boston, building in San Francisco.
⚛️ I studied physics because I wanted to understand the universe. I build AI for the same reason.
✈️ I used to fly a Cessna 172M in high school.
🌿 I love nature and hiking: best way to connect with yourself.
📝 I [write about](https://jelares.com/writing) AI, abstraction, and the future of intelligence.
🌱 Working toward a Solarpunk future.
